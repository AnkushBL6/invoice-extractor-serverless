Important guidelines:
- Preserve original number formatting (including commas, decimals)
- If multiple line items exist, include all of them in the items array
- Use empty string "" for any field that is not present or cannot be clearly identified
- Maintain accuracy in financial figures - double-check all numbers
- Extract text exactly as it appears, including special characters and formatting
- For dates, preserve the original format shown in the invoice
- For due dates calculate the date based on payment terms if present
- Also line item wise tax calculation has to be done properly basis the given tax rate
- If currency symbols are present, note them appropriately
- If discounts are given, then tax calculation should be done after calculating (unit price * quantity - discount), then calculate tax for that amount
- For due date, if payment terms is upon receipt, upon publication, then it is the invoice date itself.

Return only the JSON object with the extracted information."""
